Open a terminal window and make directory ~/PUMA 
> mkdir PUMA
 
Download plasim.tgz file into directory ~/PUMA

Change into ~/PUMA directory
> cd ~/PUMA

Extract PlaSim_0318.tgz using
> tar -zxvf PlaSim_0318.tgz

Run "./configure.sh" in this directory
> ./configure.sh

Run the "Model Starter" using
> ./most.x

Choose model "PUMA" with a mouse click.
Click on the button "Save & Run" for model building and execution.

-----------------------------------

Running long simulations

Run the "Model Starter" using
> ./most.x

Select model and resolution
Switch GUI off
Switch Output on
Edit number of years to run
Edit other parameters (may be changed later in puma_namlist file)
Click on "Save & Exit"

Make a directory on a local disk with enough space, 
> mkdir /localDisk/dataDirectory

Copy runs directory to data directory
> cp ~/PUMA/puma/run/* /localDisk/dataDirectory

> cd /localDisk/dataDirectory

Edit the experiment name in most_puma_run
I used the name myExp.

Edit the namelist files (puma_namelist) if necessary
puma_namelist contains the parameters of the simulation (see PUMA User's Guide)

Start the simulation with
> most_puma_run &

-----------------------------------

Read output of long simulations

> ls -lart

PUMA has produced files puma_sp_init, myExp_REST.001, myExp_DIAG.001, myExp.001
and directory puma_restart (this directory contains restart files)

myExp.001 is file with model output

Now we need to compile and use the postprocessor (burn7) to process output. 
So go back to directory 
> cd ~/PUMA/

Change into directory of postprocessor (also called afterburner)
> cd postprocessor

A quick reference card for the usage of burn7 can be found in this directory in file "burn7qr.pdf".

But first we need to compile the postprocessor and type
> make

The postprocessor is a C++ program requiring the NetCDF C++ library
The makefile is configured to look for:
1) The include file "netcdfcpp.h" in directory /opt/local/include
2) The library file "libnetcdf_c++.*" in directory /opt/local/lib

Doing "make" should not produces errors (hopefully).

After successfull compilation copy the executable "burn7.x" to ~/bin
and make sure, that the PATH variable includes $HOME/bin with
> echo $PATH

If this is the case, burn7.x can be executed from every directory.

Now open a new terminal (a new shell is needed to garanty that burn7.x is available) 
and go back to the data directory
> cd /localDisk/dataDirectory

Type for usage
> burn7.x

To process data type we first have to specify what the postprocessor should do.
This is done by a namelist.

Create and edit namelist scriptfile "doBurn7" within dataDirectory

Example:
nano doBurn7

VTYPE  = Pressure
HTYPE  = Grid
CODE   = 134 	#surface pressure
hPa    = 1000
MEAN   = 0
GRIB   = 0
NETCDF = 1
MULTI  = 92 	#for 92 input files 

Check burn pdf for more details

Copy file doBurn7 in the data directory and execute it as following
> burn7.x infile outfile.nc <doBurn7 >burn7.out

Look at burn7.out and you see, what burn7.x did.
>cat burn7.out
>ncdump -h outfile.nc

Check out doBurn7:
 It writes a file namelist and executes burn7.x
 $1 and $2 are the first and second argument given to doBurn7

The data are now in outfile.nc if NETCDF in namelist is 1.
You can now start R and read the data using readPUMAnc.r.

----------------------------------

Here's your exercise:

Compare SLP of observations (GMSLP from former exercises) with PUMA data.
Does PUMA reproduce features of observations?

To this end, run PUMA for 92 years, take out december months and compare 
mean(SLP) and first and second EOF for regions:
Euroatlantic and Tropics.

Good luck!
